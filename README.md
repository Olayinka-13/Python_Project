# Python_Project
As part of my Python Data Analyst degree program, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a data set from Prosper Loan.
Prosper Loan is the first American lending platform that has funded over 9 billion dollars in loans.
The data set consists of 113,937 rows and 81 columns, including information such as loan amount, terms, BorrowersRate, employment status, and more.
My objective was to analyze the data set and present a summary of my findings to potential customers.
Additionally, I aimed to identify the factors that influence the interest rate on Prosper loans.
